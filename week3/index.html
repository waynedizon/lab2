		<h2 style="text-align:center;">I'm Wayne Dizon</h2>
		<p style="text-align:center;"> My name is <strong><span class="note">Wayne Denise Dizon</span></strong>, but I go by Wayne. <br>
		I'm 19 years old and was born on March 21, 2004. <br>
		I graduated from <span class="note"><em>Makati Science High School</em></span>, located in Makati City. <br>
		Currently, I'm furthering my education by pursuing a <strong><span class="note"><abbr title="Bachelor of Science in Information Technology">BSIT</abbr></span></strong>, <br>
		specializing in Mobile and Internet Technology. <br>
		This field ignites my passion as I'm eager to establish myself in the dynamic realm of technology.<br>

		<h2 style="text-align:center;">Let's break the ice</h2>
		<p style="text-align:center;"> I have two big goals. <br>
		One, I want to <span class="note"><em> finish college with really good grades.</em></span> <br>
		And two, I want to really understand <span class="note"><em>who I am and what I love doing,</em></span> <br>
		and I want to make sure I can earn enough money to have a good life. <br>
		These are the things I'm working towards every day.
