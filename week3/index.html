        <h2>I'm Wayne Dizon</h2>
		<p> My name is Wayne Denise Dizon, but I go by Wayne. 
		I'm 19 years old and was born on March 21, 2004. 
		I graduated from Makati Science High School, located in Makati City. 
		Currently, I'm furthering my education by pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, specializing in Mobile and Internet Technology. 
		This field ignites my passion as I'm eager to establish myself in the dynamic realm of technology.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Let's break the ice</h2>
		<p> I have two big goals. 
		One, I want to finish college with really good grades. 
		And two, I want to really understand who I am and what I love doing, 
		and I want to make sure I can earn enough money to have a good life. 
		These are the things I'm working towards every day.
